      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start training our drone to explore the environment in search of objects.
We choose a very simple object to search for, in this case a red ball. And we use an equally simple movement: turn around.</description>

      <description>For our DroneTrainer project, it is useful to be able to use the most widespread tool to create DeepLearning applications: the Jupyter notebook.
For this reason we have modified the SumoControl control program so that it can be used by Jupyter.</description>

      <description>The Jumping Sumo drone manifacturer distributes an app that allows you to control it from your mobile, but we instead we prefer a web interface to it.
For our project, we are interested in controlling it with an artificial intelligence that will be executed in our Jetson Nano edge server.</description>

      <description>The first challenge was to connect the edge server, based on the Jetson Nano, to the Jumping Sumo drone. The server uses a variant of the Linux Ubuntu operating system. The drone uses the ROS operating system which is also based on Linux.</description>
