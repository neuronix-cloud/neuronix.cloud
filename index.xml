      <description>Our Drone Trainer project is a true &amp;ldquo;work in progress&amp;rdquo;. Our current problem is generating synthetic images in 3D to train our drone.
We tried several possibilities to generate the model.</description>

      <description>After experimenting for a while with Godot, we reached the conclusion that it is not appropriate for our needs.
Our goal is to easily generate 3D models and manipulate them in code, in order to generate and export images to train our models.</description>

      <description>Our project to instruct a drone to move in a room continues.
We want to instruct the drone to find a ball in a room. Our very first attempt, collecting images taken from the drone and building a model above, gave 75% accuracy.</description>

      <description>On our journey to teach a drone to move around a room, we taught it to go around and look around, collecting images.
We then collected a few images and used them to instruct a model with TensorFlow.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start training our drone to explore the environment in search of objects.
We choose a very simple object to search for, in this case a red ball. And we use an equally simple movement: turn around.</description>

      <title>Using Jupyter to Control the Drone</title>

      <description>For our DroneTrainer project, it is useful to be able to use the most widespread tool to create DeepLearning applications: the Jupyter notebook.
For this reason we have modified the SumoControl control program so that it can be used by Jupyter.</description>

      <description>The Jumping Sumo drone manifacturer distributes an app that allows you to control it from your mobile, but we instead we prefer a web interface to it.
For our project, we are interested in controlling it with an artificial intelligence that will be executed in our Jetson Nano edge server.</description>

      <title>Connecting to the Drone</title>

      <description>The first challenge was to connect the edge server, based on the Jetson Nano, to the Jumping Sumo drone. The server uses a variant of the Linux Ubuntu operating system. The drone uses the ROS operating system which is also based on Linux.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start the educational project DroneTrainer which aims to introduce to a wide audience the topics of Deep Learning, Robotics and autonomous driving.
  We have chosen equipment that is very cheap and accessible to everyone.</description>
