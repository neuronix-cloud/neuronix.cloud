Let's start the #Neuronix educational project #DroneTrainer which aims to introduce to a wide audience the topics of Deep Learning, Robotics and autonomous driving.

We have chosen equipment that is very cheap and accessible to everyone. The Robot to drive is Parrot's Jumping Sumo. The Nvidia Jetson Nano, a small computer with a capable GPU, will provide the  intelligence to train Neural Networks. Hardware cost is less than 300 euros.

All the sources of the project will be published as open source on GitHub. Also there will be a website will with  all the documentation.

You can see the current results, which we plan to improve further by educating the models, and why not, also with external contributions, in this video on YouTube.
